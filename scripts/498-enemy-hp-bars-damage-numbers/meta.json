  "setup": "Set up the constants however you like; the 'COLOR_' constants will need to be set according to your tileset. The other constants don't NEED to be changed, but can change how the health bar and damage text looks.Do not change any constants that use 'DEFINE' in their type.Assign the generic script to a slot, and either assign the example onLaunch script to the global onLaunch slot or merge it with another onLaunch script.",
