  "info": "This script disables the use of the keyboard, except for the Ex keys, and allows Link to be controlled via the mouse instead. It is meant to be used with diagonal movement and without selectable A-button items. Left-click an area away from Link to make him walk; clicking near him will cause him to use his sword. Right-clicking uses the item equipped to the B button. Scrolling up is equivalent to pressing the L key; scrolling down is used for the R key.",
