The point of using it is for testing scripts and changing parameters of the mouse depending on what's happening in order to get visual feedback.

These are intended to be put in your main global loop. The former function uses the default constants for each of the parameters, while the latter lets you specify various things. The function parameters are as follows:\n\nmouse_layer: The layer to draw the mouse to. Defaults to layer 7.\nmouse_color: The color in the palette to draw the mouse in. Defaults to 0x02 (gray from CSet 0 in the classic tileset).\nmouse_opacity: Opacity of the mouse. Defaults to opaque.\nmouse_style: Whether to render the mouse with the normal chunky look or a thinner look. \n\nEach of these variables has a corresponding constant.\n\nThe test quest included changes the color of the mouse if you hold down \"R\".",
