  "description": "Have you ever played RPG`s? Or metroidvanias? Well, one thing that can turn the tables when fighting certain enemies is status effects that affect character in various ways after certain events, being getting hit by certain enemies or using certain items. They can be negative, like poison or petrification, or positive, like invincibility or regeneration. All in all this library allows to bring status effects in ZC! By default, it features 8 negative status effects to use, but you can add more effects, insluding positive ones.All status effects have 4 phases:1. Has started. This phase indicates the moment the status effect has bee induced. The code here runs one time.2. Active. Default state of effect. Runs every frame until timer expires, unless status effect is permanent.3. Has expired. Occurs, when status effect timer has expired naturally. Code here runs once. Permanent status effects can`t have this state.4. Has cleared. Occurs, when status effect has been cleared prematurely by any way. The best example is neutralizing poison with antidote.",
