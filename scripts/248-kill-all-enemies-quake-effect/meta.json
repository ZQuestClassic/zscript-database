  "info": "Slap this into the item pick-up slot on a \"Kill All Enemies\" item to add a quake effect, and a sound effect to the item. Simple, but creates an extra layer of detail.",
  "description": "Very easy. Just compile it, and add it into the item's pick-up script slot. Note that it can be technically attached to any item to make the effect, but the enemies won't die unless it is a Kill All Enemies item.\n\nD0 in the item script tab is the sound effect to play. I recommend the AlttP 'quake' sfx, but default sound 15 works well too.\n\nExample Quest",
