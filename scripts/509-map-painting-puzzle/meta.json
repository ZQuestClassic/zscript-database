  "description": "You are given a political map of fantasy kingdom, divided into regions, some of then share borders. Also you are given 4 colored paints. To solve the puzzle, you need to colour all regions, so no two regions that share a border (touching just corners don`t count), have the same color. Some of the regions cannot be repainted, besides being accounted for solution.Stand on map region and press Ex1 to cycle between 4 possible colors.",
  "setup": "1.Build the puzzle: place combos so the same combos being orthogonally adjacent form map regions. 2.Paint those placed combos with CSET_MAPPAINT_COLOR* CSets.   Make sure that all combos in each region will have the same CSet.    Make sure that at least two adjacent regions have the same CSet, or secrets will pop open, as puzzle is already solved.3.Flag all combos in the map with CF_MAPPAINT_PUZZLE. You may also lock color of certain regions by placing CF_MAPPAINT_PUZZLE_LOCKED flag on all combos of that region.4.Place invisible FFC with the script anywhere in thw screen. No arguments needed.",
