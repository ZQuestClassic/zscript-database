And each trigger cannot be used more than once in the password. Damn flag disappearance on hit.Any way to change trigger combo counts as hit and is checked by script, whether it`s a correct or wrong hit, according to password.D0 to D5 - Switch order password. Mouse over switch combo in ZQuest editor and read number labeled as Pos:###D0 #####.____ - #1, ____.#### - #2D1 #####.____ - #3, ____.#### - #4And so on, Max 12 entries in passwordD6 - Use custon cooldown, in frames, between switch hits, instead of default one.D7 - 1->Flag for alternate setup process,  +2->No sound, +4 - allow changing combos by standing on them and press EX1, +8 - rotation animation",
