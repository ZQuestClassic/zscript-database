  "description": "ffcscript.zh is a small library with a few functions for setting up FFCs to run scripts automatically. It's most often used by items, as launching an FFC script is generally simpler than using the global script.",
  "setup": "Just extract the file and import it, along with std.zh.There are three constants at the top of the header that can be configured. FFCS_INVISIBLE_COMBO is used to specify which combo will be used. This should be a combo with a blank tile and no type or inherent flag. FFCS_MIN_FFC and FFCS_MAX_FFC are the first and last FFCs it will grab automatically. This allows you to reserve some FFCs for other purposes.",
