  "setup": "- IMPORTANT: make sure the constant doesn't interfere with other scripts. It generally won't, but be careful if you like using FFC->Misc more than necessary.\n\n- Set up your initial state.\n- Create your FFCs, assigning them an initial state (D0) and graphics (D1 and D2) for their alternate state. (i.e. if it starts on, provide the off Combo/CSet and vice versa)\n- Determine which FFCs are \"adjacent\". They need not be physically adjacent- if you're going for a confusing variant. Just assign them to D3-D6.\n- Determine the solved state (D7)\n- Set up PuzzleCheck.\n\n- WARNING: I can't guarantee that this will work if your switches are really close together.\n\nThis script requires Puzzle Check (another script)",
