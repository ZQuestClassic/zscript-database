  "description": "You need std.zh and probably ffcscript.zh (just in case).//Import Script as normal//Setup your title screen - MAKE SURE YOU BLOCK LINK'S MOVEMENTS with solid combos. (Just in case he can move for some odd reason, which should NOT happen)Also make sure that Link is set to Invisible, and your secret sound is \"none\" in the Screen Settings (F9).You can set the sound using D0 of the FFC.//Place ffc in title screen room (use a valid combo), and set this script to it.//Set D0 to the sound you want to use when you press Start//Set D1 to the amount of time you want to make it wait before warping to the target screen.//Setup a combo with the AutoSideWarp type, that blends with your title screen//Make the autowarp tile the secret combo (16-31)//Place Secret Tile 0 flag in the room//Setup your warps using the screen/dMap you want to go to, and the warp you used for the AutoSideWarp combo.(If you used AutoSideWarp(D), then you need to setup Side Warp (D) with your destination.",
