  "setup": "Set up the sprite and SFX constants at the top of the script to the appropriate values for your quest.Compile and assign all three scripts: MonarchAscendant, MonarchAscendantWeapons, and MonarchSpawnMake two new Other type enemies for the Monarch Ascendant and butterfly spawn. Set their original tiles to the top left of both enemies in the included spritesheet.Assign Monarch Ascendant its NPC Action script and set its Attributes as follows:Attribute 1: HP percentage 1-100 where the boss performs its superattack.Attribute 2: The enemy ID of the butterfly spawn enemy.Attribute 3: Frame delay between the spawns activating and chasing Link. Depending on how much HP you give them and the player's equipment you may want to make this longer to prevent getting overwhelmed.\nIf Attribute 2 isn't set to anything, the boss will skip its superattack. Also the spawn enemies don't need their script set unless you're using them outside of the boss fight but if you do, set InitD[0] to 1 to flag them as active.\n\nThis script requires std.zh and NPCAnim.zh.",
