  "description": "You have grid (any shape) filled with arrows, some of them can be rotated, for instance, with a multi-state switch. Any means of combo changing work here. A starting arrow points at another arrow, and chain goes on. If arrow points at bomb (CF_ARROW_PATH_FAILURE), puzzle is failed explosively. If arrow points at goal, (CF_ARROW_PATH_GOAL), puzzle is solved.",
  "setup": "1. Set up combos for arrows, use  CF_ARROW_PATH_DIR_* as inherent flags for defining arrow pointing direction.2. Build the puzzle area.  Surround puzzle area with NoPushBlock, also use that flag as obstacles.3. Additionally you may place bombs, flagged with CF_ARROW_PATH_FAILURE.4. Place FFC with script at start position and flag CF_ARROW_PATH_GOAL for goal point. D0 - starting direction. 0 - up, 1 - dpwn, 2- left, 3- right.",
