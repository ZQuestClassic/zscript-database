  "info": "This is a basic Freeform Combo script which allows the FFC to fire weapons either in a specific direction or at Link. They can be used for statues that shoot things other than fireballs, or if used with inherit combo flags and FFC changers, it can be used to help spruce up \"2.10 custom bosses.\"",
  "description": "Setup Instructions\n\nThe only header that is required is std.zh.\n\nAfter adding this to your scripts, simply add a FFC with the script attached to it and set any parameters you want.
