  "description": "This is another take on the pot breaking script.-Use large animation sprites-Efficient scan reduces minimizes slow-down in heavily scripted roomsWhile the script is more complicated and uses several global variables, it should still be relatively easy to implement and modify.",
  "setup": "1. Get screen_change.zh. Copy the code into a text file, give it the .zh extension, and keep it in\n    the same directory as zQuest. Make sure import \"TheFileName.zh\" is at the very beginning of\n    the file (up there with import \"std.zh\")\n2. Also have int Pots[176]; and int nPots; declared as global variables.\n3. Put the following two lines to the main loop of your global script.\n    ScreenChange_Update();\n    Pot_Script();\n4. Change the constants to suit your needs. Their all described with comments.\n5. The global script at the bottom called \"reset\" is optional. It fixes a very minor bug where if Link\n    dies and continues in the same room, pots in that room may temporally lose their\n    breaking properties.  Put this script in the onExit: slot.",
