  "info": "It's a beamos from A Link to the Past. Fill your whole quest with them, fill a Parallel World with them, maybe even fill a Barracks with them.",
  "description": "The enemy stays in one spot and its eye rotates around it. If it lines up with Link, it flashes briefly and then fires off a laser. It won't fire at Link through solid objects and its beam cannot pass through solid objects. The enemy was not intended to be killable, but that's up to you.",
  "setup": "This enemy uses the Autoghost global script, so be sure you have that set up properly.\n\nFirst, you'll want to set the constants in the script as indicated in the comments. Most of them are just optional settings for the enemy's behavior and don't need to be changed to use the script, but in particular these ones will vary from quest to quest:COLOR_BEAMOS_LASER1 & COLOR_BEAMOS_LASER2: These are the colors used by the laser. By default they're set up for the Pure 2.5 set. Colors use hexadecimal, so be sure to include the 0x at the start. After that the first number or letter is the CSet and the second is the color.CMB_BEAMOS_LASER_ENDPOINT & CS_BEAMOS_LASER_ENDPOINT: The combo and CSet used for the ends of the laser as it comes out and collides with a wall. The ones I used are just a regular stationary tile, but if you're using custom graphics you could animate them.SFX_BEAMOS_SIGHT & SFX_BEAMOS_LASER: Sounds for when the enemy sees Link and fires a laser. You can find these on HelpTheWretched's website for Zelda SFX. They use the Zora fireball and boss tail whip sounds respectively.\nNext, set up an Other type enemy and set its Misc. Attributes in the Data 2 tab like so:Attribute 1: Set this to the starting angle for the eye in degrees. Angles in ZC start with 0 facing right and go clockwise.Attribute 2: Set this to the speed at which the eye turns. A negative number will make it go counterclockwise.Attribute 3: Set this to how long the beamos will turn after firing a laser before firing another (in 60ths of a second).Attribute 4: Set this to 0 or 1 depending on whether or not the enemy should have collision detection. Setting this to 1 will make it so the enemy can't hurt you with contact damage but also you can't hurt it. It's meant for placing it on top of a solid combo so it appears that the enemy is a solid obstacle.Attribute 11: Set this to the first of 10 combos used for the enemy's graphics:\nCombo 1: The top half of the beamosCombo 2: The bottom half of the beamosCombo 3: The eye facing upCombo 4: The eye facing downCombo 5: The eye facing leftCombo 6: The eye facing rightCombo 7: The eye facing left-upCombo 8: The eye facing right-upCombo 9: The eye facing left-downCombo 10: The eye facing right-downAttribute 12: Set this to the script slot this script was loaded into.\nLastly, this script uses two functions from theRandomHeader.zh. Because it's not a commonly used header, I packaged the functions at the bottom of the script. If you're using theRandomHeader.zh or have these functions elsewhere in your scripts, delete the dulplicates.\n\nRequires std.zh and ghost.zh.",
