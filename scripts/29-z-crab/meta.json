  "description": "This script approximately recreates the movement pattern of crabs found on Toronbo Shores in Link's Awakening. These enemies will wander around, but immediately zoom towards Link whenever he's close to horizontally aligned with them.In more technical terms, this script creates an AutoGhosted enemy that walks around, without stopping, in random 4-way directions for bounded random distances. If Link gets in its horizontal path, it speeds up by a factor determined by misc. attributes and zooms in his direction.",
