  "description": "This is a ghosted enemy that's designed with customization in mind. I may update it in the future with more attacks and movement behaviors that people suggest.\n\nUpdate 4/13/18: Minor update. I fixed some basic ghost settings that should've been enabled from the start. Enemies can now be stunned. I also added a flag for enabling knockback.\nUpdate 8/17/19: A small update where I was going to just take the file back from Avataro and fix some things actually turned into a bit of a big update.All attacks now have a global delay with attack animations of varying length. Hopefully there'll be no more getting hit by attacks you couldn't see coming at point blank.A few attacks have been rebalanced and nerfed to be more reasonable.laser.zh is no longer required and laser hitboxes should hopefully be improved overall. No more big laser phantom hitting you with the back end.You can now shave up to 15 pixels off the edges of an enemy's hitbox with Attribute 5New animations for teleports and custom death explosionsNew attacks, movement types, and a new flag\nUpdate 9/16/19: Another big one here. I added a ton of new attacks and new types of attacks, now the script has 70 of them. I've decided to stop fussing so much over organization of the thing so much.Rebalances to some attacks suggested by AvataroUpdates to a couple movement styles (Hopping, Teleporting, and Hopping Fast) to make them more customizableA new flag, for preventing stunFlying enemies now have Fake Z and shadowsTwo new special attack types: Constant and TransformA bunch of new attacksWeapon rotation is now no longer based on weapon type when a custom sprite is set. My apologies for any inconvenience this causes.\nUpdate 2/24/20: Very small update. Just fixed a bug with the EZB_DONT_REPEAT_LAST_ATTACK setting when an enemy only has one attack.\nUpdate 6/29/20: Another sizeable update. The focus this time is extra FFC scripts that can be used to give enemies more attacks and customization. A lot of stuff has changed so make sure to keep backups in case some of your enemies break.A new alternate setting for how lasers will appearReworked attack and transformation selectionThe ability to give bosses >3 attacksThe ability to give bosses more than one transformable form. Transformations no longer have to be sequentialThe ability to recolor lasers and shockwaves per enemyThe ability to have an enemy transform on deathOne new special attack type: Speed UpA new flag that makes enemies' attacks happen in a fixed sequence",
  "setup": "Warning: This is an Autoghosted enemy. This means you need to not just have the ghost.zh header imported, but you also need the GhostZHActiveScript (included in ghost.zh) in your Active global script slot. Without this, the enemy's script will not load even if you set it as instructed in the enemy editor.\n\nConstants:\nFirst, you'll want to set up the constants at the top of the script for your quest. A (*) indicates a set of similar named constants. Here are the most important ones:C_EZB_LASER*: The three colors for the lasers. These numbers should be written in hexadecimal (preceded by an 0x). The first character is the cset and the second the color within that cset.C_EZB_SHOCKWAVE*: Similar to the above but for the shockwaves during certain jump attacks.SFX_EZB_*: Various sounds for things the boss does.EZB_DONT_REPEAT_LAST_ATTACK: If 0, attacks can repeat freely. If 1, attacks will never repeat. If 2, attacks will never repeat unless there's only 2 attacks.EZB_DO_WINDUP_SHAKE: If 2, both medium and strong attacks will make the enemy shake during the windup. If 1, just strong attacks will. If 0, none of them will.EZB_FORMCHANGE_ANIM: Affects enemy death tranformations. If 0, enemies will play no animation when transforming. If 1, the animation will play when the enemy's size changes. If 2, the animation will always play.EZB_TELEPORT_TYPE: If 0 the enemy will blink when teleporting, if 1 it'll stretch its tile upwards, if 2 it'll use an offset from the enemy's base tile, directly following the firing tiles.EZB_ENABLE_SPEEDTRAILS: If 1, dash attacks will have speed trails. Purely visual, take it or leave it.EZB_WINDUP_*: The durations of various delays before attacks. Measured in 60ths of a second.SPR_EZB_DEATHEXPLOSION: If >0 a sprite (Weapons/Misc) will be used for the enemy's explosion animation. Otherwise it'll be the Zelda 1 bomb effect.WIDTH_EZB_DEATHEXPLOSION / HEIGHT_EZB_DEATHEXPLOSION: The tile width and height of the explosion sprite.EZB_DEATH_FLASH: If 1, the enemy will flash different csets when exploding.EZB_ALWAYS_FAKE_Z: If 1, all enemies can be hit and can hit Link on the Z axisSTYLE_EZB_LASER: If 0 use 3 color gradient lasers. If 1 use flashing lasers.Enemy Setup:\nThe enemy itself is set up like any other autoghosted enemy, but different behaviors use different fields:Attribute 1: This is the enemy's movement style. See Movement for further details.Attribute 2: This is the enemy's first attack (0 for none). See Attacks for further details.Attribute 3: This is the enemy's second attack (0 for none). See Attacks for further details.Attribute 4: This is the enemy's third attack (0 for none). See Attacks for further details.Attribute 5: This determines how many pixels (0-15) are shaved off the top/bottom and left/right edges of the hitbox. It's a combination of two numbers: X Shave and Y Shave. To get the final value you set here, take X Shave + (Y Shave * 16)Attribute 6: This is a special value used by some of the attacks.Attribute 7: Set this to how big you want the enemy to be, in tiles. If it's a square enemy this is both the width and height. Otherwise set it to Height*16+Width.Attribute 8: Set this to give the projectiles the enemy fires a different sound.Attribute 9: Set this to give the projectiles the enemy fires a different sprite. Also sets rotation.4 Way Rotation (AKA what ZC uses): Add +1000 to Attribute 9360 Degree Rotation: Add +2000 to Attribute 9Attribute 10: Set this to the sum of all the enemy's flags. See Flags for further details.Attribute 11: Set this to the first of the enemy's combos. The enemy's combo setup is walking combos followed by attacking combos. There can be 2, 8, or 16 combos total depending on flags. If you're using combo teleport animations another 1, 4, or 8 combos get added on the end for that animation as well.Attribute 12: Set this to the slot this script is loaded into.Movement Styles:0 - Halting Walk (4 Directional): This is the standard walking enemy behavior in the enemy editor where it walks for a bit and then stops to shoot. Uses all the enemy editor fields it normally would. It's better used for normal enemies than bosses.1 - Constant Walk (4 Directional): This is the same as above but minus the halting period. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate.2 - Constant Walk (8 Directional): This is the standard Bat behavior from the enemy editor. Uses all the fields it normally would. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate.3 - Walk Toward Link: This makes the enemy move straight towards Link constantly. Step speed determines how fast it moves. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate. If homing is >0, it specifies a radius in which the enemy can respond to Link attacking with one of its own.4 - Wall Bounce: This will make the enemy move in a random direction and bounce off any walls it hits. Step speed determines how fast it moves. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate.5 - Periodic Re-aim: This is like Walk Toward Link only the enemy is a little less persistent, instead walking in one direction and updating its aim periodically. Step determines how fast it moves. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate.6 - Lazy Chase: This will make the enemy accelerate towards Link gradually, floating about in a sort of orbit pattern around him. Homing factor determines how fast it accelerates. Step speed determines its top speed. Attacks will still trigger periodically based on Halt Rate.7 - Hopping: The enemy alternates between pausing and hopping towards Link. Attack frequency is based on random rate. It has a 1 / (Random Rate / 2) chance of attacking after jumping with a max jump count of Random Rate. Halt Rate affects the delay between hops. Homing affects the randomness of jump directions with higher values being more random and lower being more aimed towards Link.8 - Teleporting: The enemy teleports around. It has a 1 / (Random Rate / 2) chance of attacking after teleporting with a max teleport count of Random Rate. Halt Rate affects the delay between teleports.9 - Hopping (Fast): Similar to hopping, but the enemy doesn't pause while on the ground and the jumps can vary in height. Homing determines the base height of the jump while random rate determines how much the height varies (0-80% in either direction). Halt Rate affects the randomness of jump directions with higher values being more random and lower being more aimed towards Link.10 - Run Away: The enemy will try to keep its distance from Link. Homing determines the distance it tries to keep at. If 0 it will always move away.11 - Turn at Wall: The enemy will continue to move straight until it reaches a wall at which point it'll make a turn. Random rate determines the type of turn:0: 90\u00b01: -90\u00b02: 180\u00b03: Random -90\u00b0 or 90\u00b012 - Skitter (4 Directional): The enemy will move in short bursts in four directions before halting. Random rate determines how often the enemy turns. Halt rate determines attack frequency. Homing determines how long it stays in place for.13 - Skitter (8 Directional): The enemy will move in short bursts in eight directions before halting. Random rate determines how often the enemy turns. Halt rate determines attack frequency. Homing determines how long it stays in place for.14 - Teleport (Fast): Same as teleport but the animation goes much faster.15 - Follow Wall: The enemy moves along walls. Random rate determines the type of turn:0: Clockwise1: Counterclockwise2: Random16 - Fishrobe: This is based on my fish wizard enemies from EotM. They follow the usual walking pattern but can phase diagonally and will attack Link when he steps in their line of sight. Halt Rate determines their attack cooldown length.Attack Styles:\nThe enemy can have up to three different attacks, but setting attack 2 or 3 to 0 can change the size of the attack pool to something less. If all attacks are 0, it won't do attacks at all.1 - Dash: The enemy dashes at Link to deal contact damage.2 - Projectile (Directional): The enemy fires a projectile in the direction it's facing.3 - Projectile (Aimed): The enemy fires a projectile at Link.4 - Triple Shot (Directional): The enemy fires a triple shot in the direction it's facing.5 - Triple Shot (Aimed): The enemy fires a triple shot at Link.6 - Stream (Directional): The enemy fires 10 projectiles in quick succession in the direction it's facing7 - Stream (Aimed): The enemy fires 10 projectiles at Link.8 - Breath (Directional): The enemy fires a spread of projectiles in the direction it's facing.9 - Breath (Aimed): The enemy fires a spread of projectiles at Link.10 - Bullet Sweep (Directional): The enemy fires a sweep of projectiles in the direction it's facing11 - Bullet Sweep (Aimed): The enemy fires a sweep of projectiles at Link12 - Bullet Barrage: Fires several rounds of tightly grouped projectiles at Link.13 - Bullet Swirl: Fires 5 streams of projectiles in a circular swirl pattern.14 - Bullet Rings: Releases 3 rings of bullets.15 - Laser: Fires a laser at Link.16 - Large Laser: Fires a double damage large laser at Link.17 - Laser Spread: Fires a spread of 5 lasers at Link.18 - Laser Cross: Fires four lasers in a cross pattern that spin around it.19 - Summon 1 Enemy: Uses Attribute 6 for the enemy ID.20 - Summon 2 Enemies: Uses Attribute 6 for the enemy ID.21 - Summon 3 Enemies: Uses Attribute 6 for the enemy ID.22 - Homing Shot: Fires a single slow moving projectile that homes in on Link for a little while.23 - 5 Aimed Shots (With Delays): Fires 5 projectiles at Link in succession.24 - 10 Aimed Shots (Quick): Fires 10 projectiles at Link in quick succession.25 - Aimed Bullet Circle: Fires a circle of projectiles that aim at Link.26 - 4 Way Shot (Normal): Fires projectiles in 4 directions.27 - 4 Way Shot (Diagonal): Fires projectiles in 4 directions diagonally.28 - 8 Way Shot: Fires projectiles in 8 directions.29 - Bullet Storm: Fires a storm of projectiles from one side of the screen.30 - Laser Storm: Fires random lasers horizontally.31 - Laser Expansion: Fires vertical lasers expanding from the enemy's position.32 - 2 Shots: Fires two shots on both sides of Link with a 40\u00b0 spread.33 - Bash: Similar to Dash but with limited range.34 - Shooting Dash: Same as Dash but leaves a trail of projectiles behind it.35 - Double Dash: Two dashes in a row.36 - Jump: Jumps at Link37 - Double Jump: Jumps at Link twice38 - Jump with Shockwave: Jumps at Link and creates a damaging shockwave where it lands39 - High Jump with Shockwave: Jumps high into the air, then slams down and creates a shockwave.40 - High Jump with Falling Projectiles: Jumps high into the air, then slams down and drops exploding projectiles on the arena.41 - High Jump with Falling Enemies: Jumps high into the air, then slams down and drops 4-7 enemies. The enemies use Attribute 6.

If there's no room, perform a regular dash.49 - Megalaser: Shoots a massive laser that covers most of the screen, also pushing the enemy backwards in the process. Should be used in big empty rooms only.52 - Flying Slam, Shockwave: The enemy jumps in the air, hovers for a bit, and then creates a shockwave. The shockwave is slightly smaller than the high jump version.53 - Flying Slam, Rocks Fall: The enemy jumps in the air, hovers for a bit, and then drops exploding projectiles on the arena. Spawns less projectiles than the high jump version.54 - Flying Slam, Enemies Fall: The enemy jumps in the air, hovers for a bit, and then drops enemies from above.

When they land, the effect depends on the enemy's Weapon Type.65 - Throw, Splash: The enemy throws 18 projectiles in random directions that go all over the screen. When they land, the effect depends on the enemy's Weapon Type. Best not to use this with a screen filling weapon type like fire or super bomb.66 - Linear Shots (Directional): The enemy shoots a line of projectiles of varying speed in the direction it's facing.67 - Linear Shots (Aimed): The enemy shoots a line of projectiles of varying speed at Link.68 - Teleport, Then Shoot: The enemy teleports and then shoots one shot at Link.69 - Teleport, Then Triple Shot: The enemy teleports and then shoots three spread shots at Link.70 - Triple Teleport, Then Linear Shots: The enemy teleports three times and then shoots a line of projectiles of varying speed at Link.72 - Laser Lattice: Creates a crisscross laser pattern across the entire screen, like Bastille from Forbidden Ascent.73 - Laser Dash: Move to either side of Link and leave a trail of aimed lasers.74 - Laser Box: Creates a laser box that closes in on Link's position from the sides of the screen.75 - Fast Rebound: Draw a sight line and then bounce rapidly around the screen.76 - Wall Bouncer: Shoot a projectile that bounces off walls77 - Wall Bouncer (Triple Shot): Shoot three projectiles that bounce off walls78 - Wall Bouncer (Fast): Shoot a faster projectile that bounces off walls.79 - Splitting Shot: Shoot a projectile that splits into multiple copies of itself.

These can be chained together for enemies with 3 or more cycling forms.50 - Transform (Barrier Shift): After every attack, the enemy takes on the defenses and CSet of a different enemy.51 - Transform (Complete): After every attack, the enemy takes on all properties (as accessible with ZScript) of a different enemy. The other enemy has to be using Newbie Boss as well.71 - Transform (On Death): After dying, the enemy takes on all properties (as accessible with ZScript) of a different enemy. The other enemy has to be using Newbie Boss as well.Misc Attack Styles:\nThese attacks don't fit into the other attack styles.

If you want it to have no collision at all, give it immunity to all weapons. This flag has the side effect of preventing the enemy from being affected by stunning weapons and clocks, because of how the effect is handled (it uses the stun variable).1024 - No Stun: The enemy won't be stunned by any stunning weapons. Like the above but with collision damage still enabled. This way if you have stunning weapons that also deal damage you can still damage with them without stunning.2048 - Sequential Attack: The enemy will cycle through attacks sequentially instead of at random.Extra Scripts:\nThese can be placed on the screen to give enemies extra effects. \n\nEZBoss_Effects: This is spawned by the boss itself for some attacks. Make sure it's assigned to a slot, you don't actually need to place it.\nEZBoss_ExtraAttacks: This gives the enemy additional attacks.D0: The enemy ID of the enemy to apply this script to.D1-D7: Attacks to add. 0 for none. Attack types that explicitly require the enemy's Attribute 2 can't be added this way.EZBoss_ChangeLaserColor: This changes the colors of lasers (also used for lightning) and shockwaves.D0: The enemy ID of the enemy to apply this script to.D1-D3: The three colors for the enemy's lasers. 0 for defaults. These must be converted from hexadecimal to decimal. You can preview these values using the 8-bit tile editor.D4-D6: The three colors for the enemy's shockwaves. 0 for defaults. These must be converted from hexadecimal to decimal. You can preview these values using the 8-bit tile editor.EZBoss_ExtraTransformations: This gives the enemy extra transformation options in addition to the one specified by Attribute 6. It can also extend the duration an enemy takes a certain form.D0: The enemy ID of the enemy to apply this script to.D1: The number of attacks the enemy stays in its current form for.D2: A random chance to change forms (1/n) after D1 runs out.D3-D7: Enemy IDs to add to the transformation pool. These must be using Newbie Boss to work.This script requires ghost.zh, ffcscript.zh and std.zh.",
