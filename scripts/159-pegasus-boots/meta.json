  "info": "An updated, bugfixed and more functional version of the script created by Joe123, and later modified by Zepinho for the GB script pack.Similar to versions found in LTTP and Link's Awakening.Run double speed in one direction. Break blocks. Slash through tall grass and bushes. Jump further when combined with Roc feather.",
  "description": "Building off the original script by Joe123, and the edits done by Zepinho to make it work in current versions (and add the dashSword stuff).\nOriginal version here: https://www.purezc.ne...showtopic=38916\n\nThis was a big overhaul of the script.\n- now draws dust cloud and dashSword while scrolling\n- can dash into drownable water and drown or swim (if you have flippers)\n- works with non-diagonal movement\n- dashSword is the current sword you're using, not the standard wooden sword sprite\n- dashSword damage is customizable.\n- more slashable combo types added, with easy ability to add/modify\n- modification of script to make it easier to work together with other scripts\n- lots more bugfixing\n- better documentation\n\nUpdate: removed redundant function\n\nUpdate Jan 22,2016: fixed issue where Pegasus dash would run through solid combos on Layers 1 and 2. Now solidity is respected.",
  "setup": "Only std.zh is needed.Script file includes detailed setup instructions.The example quest has it all setup, AND has a few other scripts (Sideview Ladder, Sideview Swimming, Hole/Lava, Jump-Drown Spawn, etc) in the buffer to get an idea how to combine this with other scripts. Detailed comments are found throughout the buffer version to help see what needs to be done to get to work with other things. The interaction of all the scripts in the example quest appear to be working together flawlessly.",
