  "info": "A ready-to-use multi-segment splitting worm enemy. Moves similar to a moldorm, splits like Terraria's Eater of Worlds.",
  "description": "Creates a worm enemy, with a settable number of segments. Each segment has separate HP. Killing one in the middle will cause it to split at that point. If a segment is left solo with no attached segments, it will die.Based loosely on Terraria's Eater of Worlds for the splitting, though the movement is based on Moldorms.Movement is 8-directional.",
