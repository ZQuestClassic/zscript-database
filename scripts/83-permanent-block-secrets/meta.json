To make it work, create a combo (preferably invisible) with inherent flag 16, then set the FFC's combo to that. To clarify, the FFC's own combo should have an inherent flag 16.\n\nNow as long as you aren't in an NES dungeon, the FFC will detect secret flags being activated and then permanently set the screen's secret state.\n\nRequires std.zh; included with ZC.",
