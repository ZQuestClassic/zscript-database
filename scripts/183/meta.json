  "description": "Allows Link's bombs and script created bombs (via a provided FFC script or you can make your own script) to follow conveyor belts. You can also allow these bombs to blow up when they collide with solid objects and/or traps.Script Update: (06/04/2015)1. Added three new constants that allow you to make the game play a sound when a bomb spawner spawns a new bomb, and chose whether or not bombs blow up when they run into the end of a conveyor belt.2. Changed the BombSpawner script so that setting D4 to a value of 2 or 3 will cause it to create bombs that can trigger secrets when they explode on a bombable combo.3. Added a counter argument to the BombConveyor function so that bombs should now travel at the same speed as Link does on a conveyor belt.4. Made it so that bombs on a conveyor belt can now round corners without getting hung or blowing up on the corner.Script Update: (05/27/2015)1: The BOMB_EXPLODE constant has been split into two constants, EBOMB_EXPLODE and LBOMB_EXPLODE, these constants do the same thing as the old one, except that they only affect enemy bombs and Link bombs, respectively.2: Two new constants have been added, ECONVEYOR_AUTO_EXPLODE and LCONVEYOR_AUTO_EXPLODE. Setting these constants to 1 will cause enemy and Link bombs (respectively) to blow up when they ride to the end of a conveyor belt. Handy for bombs with unlimited fuses that need to run into an unsolid space.3: A bug in the ffc BombSpawner script has been fixed that caused the script to place bombs at the wrong spot when placing them in the rightward direction.",
  "setup": "Setup is included in the script file, the following is a copy paste from the setup instructions in the script file. Note for scripters, to create your own enemy bombs that obey conveyor belts you will need to create a eweapon of type EW_CONVEYORBOMB and the set eweapon->Misc[CONVEYORBOMB_MISC_ID] equal to 1.//Setup//First, please set the below constants to the correct values, then, place BombConveyor(counter) in your global script, inside of the main loop and an if(Link->Action != LA_SCROLLING){ statement, and before Waitdraw() and Waitframe().//Also, make sure you declare a variable, increase it by 1 every frame, and have an if statement that stops it from going past 214748//If you do not already//have a global script you can just use BombConveyorGlobalExample in your active global slot, otherwise, you can just use it as an example of how to set the script up//Constantsconst int SPRITE_BOMB = 76; //The sprite id to use for enemy bombs that can ride conveyors.

Set to -1 for it to never blow up (aside from colliding with Link and stuff determined by BOMB_EXPLODE)//D3, the ffc will spawn a bomb every D3 frames. So a value of 60 would mean 1 bomb per second//D4 = whether or not to create a super bomb.//     Set to 0 to create a regular bomb,//     set to 1 to create a superbomb,//     set to 2 to create a regular bomb whose explosion effects will line up exactly with the effects of one of Links bombs (secret trigger, damage to enemies, damage to Link based on quest rule, etc)//     set to 3 to create a superbomb whose explosion effects will line up exactly with the effects of one of Links bombs (secret trigger, damage to enemies, damage to Link based on quest rule, etc)//D5 = An offset to the counter used for determining when to place bombs.
