Place FFC next to puzzle area D0 - 1st combo of poker sequence D1 - number of combos in poker sequence D2 - direction of poker line D3 -combintion type  D3 = 0 - Longest set must be that long or longer    D4 - number of same kind, D5 - target number forming set (i.e 3 6s), if D6 is odd - target set must be exactly D4 long (i,e, 4 4s, and extra 4 is failure). If D6 is <2, any extra sets will fail the check. For instance 5 elements contain 3 of a kind and remaining 2 enemies must mismatch to solve. D3 = 1 - Number of sets. D4 - set size, D5 numberof sets. if D6 is even, larger set sizes are allowed. Example - 3 pairs, more pairs are allowed if D6 is even, but quads here don`t count. D3 = 2 - Full House - all cards are part of sets, D4- maximum set length, D5 - min set length, D6 is odd -> hand must contain one set on minimum length, if specified, and 1 set of max length, if specified. D3 = 3 - Straight - sequence of ranks - D4 - number of elements in sequence. if D6 is even, longer sequences also count.",
