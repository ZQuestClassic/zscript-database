  "info": "This item creates a portal. After a specific amount of time Link warps back in time to the portal and resets his current health to what is was when he used the item. It resets only Link (excluding his magic).",
  "description": "This can be used for unique puzzles and is also useful for combat. It makes you quasi-invincible while it is active, because your health is set to the amount you had when you used the item. It's highly suggested to make the item use magic because otherwise it would be overpowered. Also, don't use a potion right after using the item or you'll waste it Small update: Added a variable that lets you change the time it waits until it warps you. I suggest 2 - 4 seconds.",
  "setup": "FFCScript.zh is required to compile the script. Here's a link to it: https://www.purezc.n...showtopic=50511\n\n1: Set the constants in the scripfile. You need the item ID, an activation SFX, a warp SFX, a combo for the portal sphere and the CSet for it. You can also change the amount of time until the item warps Link.\n2: Import the scripts.\n3: Make the item in the item editor and put it in the subscreen so that the player can use it. Give it the magic clock item script for it's activation script slot. I suggest making the item require magic so that it's not overpowered.",
