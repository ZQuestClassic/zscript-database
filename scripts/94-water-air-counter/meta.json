  "setup": "There are basically two parameters:- Link_WaterMaxCounter : it is the maximum time in frames that Link can swim without drowning. 60 frames = 1 second- Link_WaterCounter : it is the actual state of Link air meter. You could set it to 0 if you want Link to drown or reset it to the maximum for more air. You could use it for example in an underwater level with bubbles that reset the air counter...NOTE: use it with flippers.",
