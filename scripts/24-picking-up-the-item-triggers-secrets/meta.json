  "description": "This script will trigger the screen secrets when there is no room item on the screen. Items dropped by enemies, bushes or other scripts, etc won't be counted. Only the item that you place on the screen manually matters. You can use this, for example, to open a path when the player picks up the key, or something like that. You can also define if it should play a sound effect or not.",
