  "setup": "You will need ffcscript.zh and stdExtra.zh for this one. Make sure you set the constants in the mentioned header files before continuing. Import both of them as well as string.zh.\n\nCreate a new item and give it a custom itemclass. Make sure it's an equipable item. For a fancier effect, set the item in your subscreen, but also make it unselectable; as in, go to the item's subscreen attributes and set it's position to -1.\n\nChange MEDICINE_ID to the item's ID value in the script. After that, simply combine it with your global script.",
