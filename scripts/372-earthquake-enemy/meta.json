  "description": "QUAKE MASTER\n(perfect to upgrade classical Bosses)\n\nThe script gives an enemy the ability to cause earthquake and (screen shake, item jinx, sword jinx), in a variable loop (delay before erathquake and before the loop restarts).\nGive the enemy a sound you want it to use for the eathquake\n(I modified the \"Stone Door Slam\" from OoT and combined it, with a pitched version of OoT's \"Ganon Scream\" SFX wave - made in audiacity)",
  "setup": "- required headers: \"std.zh\"\n\nLoad the script in the \"Action Script\" slot of an enemy, you want.\n\nD0 = Time before the earthquake begins\nD1 = SFX you want to use for the quake attack\nD2 = Delay before the loop restarts",
