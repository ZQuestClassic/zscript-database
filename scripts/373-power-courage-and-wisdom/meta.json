  "setup": "requires \"std.zh\"\n\nCreate LttP Amulets, OoT Spiritual ore selectable Triforce Fragments and assign 1 of these scripts in the active slot.\n\n\"GoldenForce1\" can add 2 variable items (Sword 5-6 + related Armor/Ring you decided to use) and remove a max of 6 items (added by the other GoldenForce Items).\n\"GoldenForce2\" can add 3 variable items (Sword 6-7 + Armor/Ring 3rd variable item) and remove a max of 5 items (while there is no need to remove Sword and Armor items, if used to add the highest level Sword/Armor).\n\nThe 3rd addable Item, of \"GoldenSwords2\" is meant to gain an invisible/unused item to your inventory. I used it to add the Charge Ring L2 as long as I use the \"Triforce of Wisdom Status\" (GoldenForce2)\n\nThe PureMasterBlade Script removes all items, possibly gained by GoldenForce1/2 and restores the \"original\" state of your hero (free of triforce powers).",
