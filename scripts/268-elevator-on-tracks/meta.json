  "description": "This is a script for an elevator that moves along a track. I've tested it mainly in sideview, but it may work in top down screens as well for something like the Somaria platforms in Turtle Rock in ALttP.",
  "setup": "Firstly you'll want to set all the constants at the top of the script for your quest.Place down the tracks for your elevator with the combo flags CF_ELEVATOR for most of the track and CF_ELEVATORSTOP for places you can get off at. Place the elevator FFC on top of a CF_ELEVATORSTOP combo. If you're using a bigger than 1x1 elevator like I am in the example quest, set D0 and D1 to the X and Y offsets for the 1x1 hitbox for the elevator. You want this hitbox to be overlapping the CF_ELEVATORSTOP combo.If there's no CF_ELEVATORSTOP on the screen, put down an invisible elevator FFC with D2 set to what its combo should be. You need a copy of this script on every screen an elevator can pass through even if there's not one there.The FFC itself does not actually have a solid bottom (solid FFCs have a history of being buggy), so be sure you put safety platforms underneath your elevators.This script uses std.zh and ffcscript.zh (purely for the FFCS_INVISIBLE_COMBO constant).",
