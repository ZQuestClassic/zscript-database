  "setup": "Headers: EmilyMisc.zh (v1.3 or higher), ffcscript.zh, std.zh1. Set up constants in the script, as follows. Any which list a default will work fine at their default value.BARREL_ITEM (must be manually set!): ID of the item which will be used to run the barrel item scriptDRAW_LAYER (default 6): layer to draw the spotlight/npc line of sight onDRAW_OPACITY (default OP_TRANS): the opacity to draw the line of sight/spotlight inWARP_SFX (default 0): The SFX to play when warping.WARP_FLAGS (default 0): The set of flags to use for WarpEx - use `WARP_FLAG_` constants from std.zh.CAUGHT_SFX (default 0): The SFX to play when you are noticed2. Set up the passive item script:For the item you set to BARREL_ITEM,Make sure `Equipment Item` is checked. The Item Class should be a `Custom ItemClass ##` class.Under `Flags`, check `Constant Script`Set an LTM, and create associated graphics, to make the hero look like he's walking while under a barrel.Assign the \"Action Script\" as `barrelItem`Set parameters-D0: If 0, barrel can only be placed on walkable areas. Else, ignores solidity.D1: If 0, all graphics are handled by the link tile modifier. If 1, the barrel combo will be drawn over link when he is hiding.* Note: the walking tiles still need to be handled by the LTM.Set QR- `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Item Scripts Run for Multiple Frames` must be checked3. Set up patrol enemies!Place the enemy using an inherent enemy placement flag, on a path of placed flags (of any type, preferrably a scripted flag)* Or, spawn the enemy using a script, on a placed path of flags (instead of using an inherent placement flag).* * The included `ffc script enemyPlacement` can be used for this.* It will follow these flags in a path, and if it sees Hero, it will play a cutscene of running towards him and then jail him.* The enemy will ignore all solidity, to follow this path.D0: The color to use to draw the line of sight. Use `0` for no drawing.D1: DMap to warp toD2: Screen to warp toD3: Warp return square to use. 0-3 for A-D, -1 for pit warpD4: Forward sight range, in pixelsD5: Forward sight angle (between 0 and 90, inclusive. 0/1 are tunnel vision, 89/90 are wide vision). Recommended: 45.D6: If 0, will prefer clockwise movement at turns, else, counterclockwise.D7: Flag to follow. If 0, uses placed flag being stood on. Reading `npc->InitD[7]` will tell you what flag is being used.Enemy Editor data:* Enemy type should be \"Other\"* Step speed will be used for the movement* Defenses should ALL be set to \"Block\", unless you want the guard to be killable of course.* If you set it to be unkillable, be sure to set \"Doesn't count as beatable enemy\"* Homing Factor / Halt Rate / Random Rate / Hunger are totally ignored.* Damage will be forcibly set to 0. Weapon damage is unaffected.Set QR: `ZScript->Quest Script Settings->Sprite Coordinates are Float` must be checked4. Placing barrelsPlace an FFC, and set the script to `hidableBarrel`.Set the combo to look like a barrel, should look similar to the graphics used for your LTM....That's it. Barrel done.5. Placing SpotlightsPlace an FFC, and set the script to `spotlight`.Set the combo to something invisible.Set parameters:D0: The color to use to draw the spotlight. Use `0` for no drawing.D1: DMap to warp toD2: Screen to warp toD3: Warp return square to use. 0-3 for A-D, -1 for pit warpD4: Radius of circle, from center of FFC, to be a spotlight.Movement: You can set this up using default FFC movement, and changers. No scripted movement is provided.////////////////////////////////If you are confused with any part of this setup, reference the test quest included with the package.
