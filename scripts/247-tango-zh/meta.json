  "description": "tango.zh provides a text display system much more powerful than ZC's built-in message system. It allows greater control over appearance and behavior, custom fonts, and some scripting capabilities. It also provides a simple system for creating menus in both text and ZScript.Latest update 1.3.2 (2019-08-01)* Fixed an erroneous delay after the player responds to @pressa().* Activating a slot using a style with no font set now reports an error.* Replaced tango.txt, tangoUsage.txt, and tangoFAQ.txt with HTML documentation.",
