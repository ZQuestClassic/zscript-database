  "setup": "This script only uses std.zh.\n\n\nCounterPotions:\nGetting Started:\nCompile the script as usual.\nPlace the script into the action script slot of whatever item you want to restore a counter item.\n\n\nArguments:D0: Set this to the sfx (sound effect) you wish for the item to use. 0 defaults to the refill sfx.D1: Set this to the assigned number for the counter item you wish to increase.D2: Set this to how much you want the counter item to increase.\nKeep in mind that magic and life increase with higher numbers than arrows or bombs. Life for instance, would require a 16 for its D2, to increase Link's health by 1 heart. Experiment with magic as magic is more confusing and may differ depending on quest.\nNeed to Know:\n\nTo properly define your D arguments, you need to know what each number represents.SFX (D0)\nTo find the number of a particular SFX, go to...\nQuest->Audio->SFX Data (the number will appear next to the sound effect)Counter (D1)\nYou can find the counter item in std_constants. To make it simple, here is the list...\n                   Life = 0\n                   Rupees = 1\n                   Bombs = 2\n                   Arrows = 3\n                   Magic = 4\n                   Keys = 5\n                   Super Bombs = 6\n                   Scripted Counters = 7-31\nSee your specific quest to figure out what scripted counters may be assigned to what.Increment (D2)\nThis is simple. Simply set this to how much you want the counter item to increase.\n\nThat is all you need to know. Contact me if you need assistance still.",
