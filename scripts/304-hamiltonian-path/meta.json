  "description": "I noticed the only other hamiltonian path script on the database has some odd mechanics it uses to function and figured people might want a version that works more like the ones in official Zelda games.I also added an extra feature where hookshotting onto an inactive tile works the same as stepping on an adjacent one, since I thought it could increase puzzle variety a bit.",
  "setup": "First, set the only constant, SFX_HAMILTINIAN_PATH, to the sound that you want to play when Link steps on a new tile in the path.\n\nNext, place an invisible FFC on the screen with the scirpt. Set it's arguments as follows:D0: The combo number of the inactive (not yet stepped on) path tiles.D1: The combo number of the active path tilesD2: The combo number of the path tile marking Link's current position along the pathD3: The combo number of the path tile the whole thing changes to when completedD4: Set this to 1 if the secrets triggered should be permanentD5: Set this to the SFX to play when secrets are triggered. If 0, it will use the default.\nAll combos used in the path on the screen should be the combo specified by D0. They should all be placed on layer 0. If you want a fixed starting combo for the path, you can place down one of the combo specified by D2.\n\nThis script requires std.zh.",
