  "description": "A family of timing minigames. Stand on FFC and press Ex1. A gauge appears with 2 stationary red markers and blue one that moves back and forth. Press Ex1, when blue marker is between red ones to win the game. If multiple Red Zone minigames appear in the same screen, all of them must be won simultaneously to open secrets.",
  "setup": "1. Place FFC below a solid combo. D0 - Gauge size. Must be a multiple of 16. D1 - Blue marker moving speed, in pixels per frame. D2 - lower Red marker posiion. D3 - higher Red marker posiion. D4 - >0 - turns the game into one similar to Might Test minigame from Mortal Kombat 1. Accumulate blue marker height by rapidly pressing Ex2, then land it into the Red Zone via Ex1. Higher D4 value, the fewer Ex2 presses will be needed to maximize marker height. D5 - add together:    1 - Fail the minigame, if marker hits maximum possible position (overshoot).    2 - If time limit expires, when marker in the Red Zone, the minigame counts as won. D6 - Time limit, in frames. 0 for no time limit.",
