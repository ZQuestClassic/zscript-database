  "description": "A global script that adds a jump button and some upgrade items to go with it.\n\nFeatures:Variable jump heights based on how long you hold the buttonHolding down in sideview to fall fasterThree passive items: High jump, double jump, and space jump\"Coyote time\" feature allowing jumping for a short time after walking off a platform",
  "setup": "Combine the script with your own globals and then set the following constants:\n\nItems: \nThese are the only real essential constants. If you don't want the upgrade items, set the IDs to something that isn't an equipment item. If you do want them, set up equipment items them. High Jump and Double Jump are designed to be mutually exclusive since they serve a similar purpose, but that's up to you.I_HIGHJUMPI_DOUBLEJUMPI_SPACEJUMPSFX:\nThe sound effects for the three jump types. Double jump and space jump will both follow one regular jump and can use the same sound as it or different ones if you prefer.SFX_JUMPBUTTON_JUMPSFX_JUMPBUTTON_DOUBLEJUMPSFX_JUMPBUTTON_SPACEJUMPOther Settings:JUMPBUTTON_BUTTON: Which button you want the jump to be assigned to - 0 ( L ), 1 ( R ), 2 ( Ex1 ), 3 ( Ex2 ), 4 ( Ex3 ), 5 ( Ex4 )JUMPBUTTON_ONLY_SIDEVIEW: If this is set to 1, the jump button will only work while on sideview screens.JUMPBUTTON_DECAY_IS_PERCENTAGE: If this is set to 1, the decay speed of Link's jump when the button isn't held is a percentage of the current value instead of a constant.JUMPBUTTON_IGNORE_SWEETSPOTS: If this is set to 1, Link can always double jump/space jump regardless of the current jump value.JUMPBUTTON_JUMP_HEIGHT: Link's base jump heightJUMPBUTTON_HIGH_JUMP_HEIGHT: The height of high jumpJUMPBUTTON_DOUBLE_JUMP_HEIGHT: The height of the second jump in a double jumpJUMPBUTTON_SPACE_JUMP_HEIGHT: The height of space jump. If 0, this will be the same as either normal or high jumpJUMPBUTTON_JUMP_DECAY: How fast Link's jump value decays each frame after releasing the button.JUMPBUTTON_PRESSDOWN_DECAY: How fast Link's jump value decays when pressing down in sideviewJUMPBUTTON_TERMINAL_VELOCITY: Terminal velocity as set in ZQuestJUMPBUTTON_TERMINAL_VELOCITY_DOWNINPUT: Secondary terminal velocity when holding down, if you want it to exceed the normal oneJUMPBUTTON_DOUBLE_JUMP_RANGE_MIN / JUMPBUTTON_DOUBLE_JUMP_RANGE_MAX: Min and max for the range of Link's jump value (Starts positive and counts down to -3.2 in increments of 0.16 each frame by default) where he can perform a double jump. If min is less than negative terminal velocity, it can be possible to miss the jump entirely.JUMPBUTTON_SPACE_JUMP_RANGE_MIN / JUMPBUTTON_SPACE_JUMP_RANGE_MAX: Same as above but for space jump.JUMPBUTTON_SPACE_JUMP_COOLDOWN: If space jump has a missable sweet spot range in the above setting, this determines the number of frames it takes before Link gets his jump back if he misses a jump.JUMPBUTTON_JUMP_FORGIVENESS_FRAMES: This is the number of frames after Link walks off a ledge where he's still allowed to jump as if he was still on it.
