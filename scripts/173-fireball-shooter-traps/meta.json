  "description": "Two variations of the same script are included. The first version shoots a fireball towards Link's position when he attacks (candle, wand, hammer, etc). The other variation can shoot multiple fireballs when Link attacks (default are 5 fireballs by 20 frames delayed in each). Useful to spice up your traps in dungeons (or overworld if you're crazy!)Credits to MoscowModder for providing a simple fix and LinktheMaster for his FFC shooter script, which I looked into for setting up the angle and position.",
