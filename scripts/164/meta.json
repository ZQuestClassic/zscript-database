  "description": "I know nobody is going to use this, but I decided to submit it anyways. This basically is a script that allows you to target enemies with the L button, and then fire an aimed arrow at it. I used code from other scripts, along with my own, to make this. I can't remember whose code I used, but credit to whoever they are. Also, thanks to everybody who helped me with the errors I was getting. Also, don't use ffc 32 at all if you use this in your quest.Update 1: Added more stable arrow shooting.Update 2: Added an overlay system.",
  "setup": "Just set the constants and you are ready to go!Target Combo On is what the target looks like. This is basically the ZTargetTarget Combo Off is just a blank combo. Use tile 0 or similar.Target Combo CSet is the Cset of the Target.Arrow Tile is the tile that the arrow uses.Hurt is the amount of damage the arrow does.Speed is the speed of the arrow. Just use 300 for normal results.STD is already imported in the file, but if you already imported it somewhere else, just delete that little line of code at the top.",
