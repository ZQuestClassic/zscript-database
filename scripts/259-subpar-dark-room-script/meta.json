  "info": "Just your average Dark Room script. Seems to be the first submitted to PureZC, though.",
  "description": "Since there are no Dark Roomscripts on the database, thought I might as well put this here. This script supports many lighting options on a per screen basis. This is not the same Dark Room script I've showcased before, this is a primitive Dark Room script.",
  "setup": "Requires Std.zh\n\nChange the value of the const \"LIGHT_FLAG\" to any flag number you wish to be lit up. By default, it's 98. Flags must be placed on layer 0.\n\nChange the value of the const \"BLACK_COLOR\" to the color black in your palette. This is likely going to be 15.\n\nChange the value of the const \"DARK_ROOM_SLOT\" to the slot you plan to assign the FFC to.\n\nCompile. Make sure to assign both the global and the FFC to slots!\n\nPlace a FFC down and set it to an invisible combo that's not combo 0. Assign the DarkRoom script to the FFC. Set the D arguments of the FFC as follows:\n\nD0: The size of Link's light bubble. 0 defaults to 48, use -1 to disable.\nD1: The size of the flag's light bubble. 0 defaults to 48, use -1 to disable.\nD2: The size of Link's Fire weapons' light bubble. 0 defaults to 48, use -1 to disable.\nD3: The size of enemy's fire weapons' light bubble. 0 defaults to 48, use -1 to disable.\nD4: Maximum expansion size from original size, in pixels.\nD5: How fast it expands. I recommend 2.\nD6: Item required for Link to have a light circle.  Set to the ID of the item you wish to require. Positive number requires Link to hold the item (have it equipped), negative number just requires Link to own the item. Set to 0 to disable requiring an item.",
