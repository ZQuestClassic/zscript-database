Link's Awakening Set-Up
v0.61

THis will guide you through setting up this header in a quest file. SHould you wish to avoid all the mandatory 
steps, please consider using the quest template packaged with this header. It's based on the EZGB tileset, and 
is very user-friendly, with all the LA Buff Items code, and global code installed, and in the buffer.

( ! ) You can expand it as desired.

Link's Awakening Buff Items and Secret Shells Set-Up
PLEASE REFER TO THE EXAMPLE QUEST BEFORE, AND WHILE, USING THIS HEADER.

1. If you have an existing ~Init script, comment out the global script Init in the LinksAwakening.z code, 
   and add this instruction to myour ~Init script:
	InitZ4(); //Set up the initial values used by this script. 
   
   If you do not have an ~Init script, or don't even know that that is, you may ignore this step.

2. Add tiles for the following:	
	Guardian Acorn
	Piece of Power
	Secret Shell

3. Add Sound Effects for each of the following:
		( ! ) If you already have sounds for any of these, you may safely skip adding them.
	Piece of Power Pick-Up
	Guardian Acorn Pick-Up
	Secret Shell Pick-Up
	Sound to play when attack (sword power) is buffed by Pieces of Power.
	Sound to play when defence (ring, armour) is buffed by Guardian Acorns
	Sound to play when effect of Pieces of Power expires.

7. If you are using miniboss, or boss enemies other than the stock set, note the Enemy ID ( the
   value from the Enemy Editor) for each, separating them as follows:
	Miniboss
	Boss
	FINAL BOSS - > The Final Boss in your game.
	( ! ) This is a critical step, and you MUST make this list!

8. Set up all of your SCRIPT SETTINGS, as follows:

 ( A ) 	VARIABLE CONSTANTS
	Each of these is used to establish a value called by the scripts. You can safely use the defaults 
	for each of these, or customise them as you desire.
		NEEDED_PIECES_OF_POWER = 3; //Number of Pieces of power needed for temporary boost.
					    //Default value: 3
		NEEDED_ACORNS = 3; //Number of Acorns needed for temporary boost.
	                           //Default value: 3
		REQUIRED_SECRET_SHELLS = 20; //Number of Secret Shell items to unlock the secret.
		BUFF_TIME = 900; //Duration of boost, in frames. Default is 15 seconds.
		REQUIRE_CONSECUTIVE_KILLS = 12; 	//The number of enemies the player must kill without 
							//being hurt, to obtain a free Guardian Acorn.
		REQUIRE_KILLS_PIECE_OF_POWER_MIN = 35; 	//The minimum number of enemies to kill (random number 
							//min) to obtain a free Piece of Power.
		REQUIRE_KILLS_PIECE_OF_POWER_MAX = 45; 	//The maximum number of enemies to kill (random number 
							//max) to obtain a free Piece of Power.
		BONUS_SHELL_DIVISOR = 5; //Award bonus Secret Shell if number on hand is this number, on each 
					 //visit to Seashell mansion.
		WALK_SPEED_POWERUP = 4; //Number of extra Pixels Link walks when he has a Piece of Power
		WALK_TIME = 10; //Increase this value to slow the speed at which Link walks when sped up, 
				//and to speed him up when slowed down.

( B )	BOOLEAN SETTINGS:
	Each of these acts as a toggle switch, to change script behaviour. Enable them by setting
	their value to '1', and disable them by setting their value to '0'.
	
	A select few of these act as *both* BOOLEAN SETTINGS * and * as VARIABLE SETTINGS:
		PLAY_ACORN_MESSAGE = 0; //Set to 0 to turn off Guardian Acorn messages.
					//If set to aq value of '1' or higher, when the player obtains a
					//Guardian Acorn, ZC will display a Screen->Message string using
					//the ID equal to the value you assign here. 
		PLAY_PIECE_OF_POWER_MESSAGE = 0; //Set to 0 to disable messages for Piece of Power power-ups.
						 //If set to aq value of '1' or higher, when the player obtains 
						 //a Guardian Acorn, ZC will display a Screen->Message string 
						 //using the ID equal to the value you assign here. 

		RANDOMISE_PER_PLAY = 0; //Set to '1' if you want to randomise the number of kills 
					//on each load (continue).

		PLAY_POWERUP_MIDI = 1; //Set to '1' to play a MIDI while a power-up boost is in effect.

		REMOVE_ATTACK_BOOST_WHEN_PLAYER_DAMAGED = 0; //Set to '0' to disable removing the boost 
							     //when player is damaged X times.
			//! This is UNIMPLEMENTED, or partially implemented at present.
		NUM_HITS_TO_LOSE_POWER_BOOST = 3; //The number of times a player with a Piece of Power power-up 
						  //boost must be hit, before the effect prematurely ends.
			//! This is UNIMPLEMENTED, or partially implemented at present.

		ENEMIES_ALWAYS_EXPLODE = 1; //Set to '0' if enemies only explode when a player has a Piece of 
					    //Power power-up.
		EXPLOSIONS_RUN_WITH_FFCS = 1; //If set to 1, enemy explosions on death will run from FFCs
					      //rather than from the global active infinite loop.
					
		ENEMY_POWERUPS_ARE_FULL = 1; //If set to '1' awarded Pieces of Power and Guardian Acorns from 
					     //killing enemies
					     //grant an instant *full* power-up. Otherwise, if set to '0', they 
					     //only give a single power-up item.
					
		KILL_AWARDS = 1; //Set to '0' to disable automatic awards of Pieces of Power and Guardian Acorns
				 //based on enemy kill counts.
				
		FINAL_BOSS_EXPLOSIONS = 1; //Set to '0' if you are using the stock Ganon as a final boss! 
				           //Disabling this, disables explosion animations for the enemy specified 
					   //as FINAL_BOSS_ID in variable settings, below.
					   
		RESET_ENEMY_COUNT_ON_CONTINUE = 0; //Reset the count of enemies killed for a Piece of Power 
						   //when continuing. Set to '1' to enable, or '0' to disable.
		CONSECUTIVE_ENEMY_COUNT_ON_CONTINUE = 0; //Reset thenumber of consecutive ennemies killed when continuing. 
							 //Set to '1' to enable, or '0' to disable.



9. Fill in the item, sound constants, for the following items, using the item numbers
   that you noted in Step 7:
	I_GREEN_RING = ???; //Item number of Green Ring. Default is 144.
	I_PIECE_POWER = ???; //Item number of Piece of Power. Default is 145.
	I_ACORN = ???; //Item number of Acorn. Default is 146.
	I_SHELL = ???; //Item number of Secret Shell. Default is 147.

10. In the script file, assign the constants for sounds:
	SFX_POWER_BOOSTED = ??; //Sound to play when Attack Buffed
	SFX_SECRET_SHELL = ??; //Sound to play when unlocking shell secret.
	SFX_GUARDIAN_DEF = ??; //Sound to play when Defence buffed.
	SFX_NERF_POWER = ??; //Sound to play when Piece of Power buff expires.
	SFX_NERF_DEF = ??; //Sound to play when Guardian Acorn buff expires
	SFX_BONUS_SHELL = ??; //Sound to play when awarded a bonus Secret Shell.
	SFX_ENEMY_EXPLOSION = ??; //Explosion SFX
	SFX_KILL_BONUS_POWERUP = ??; //Sound effect for a power-uop awarded by killing enemies.

11. Set up the following ENEMY EXPLOSION values, as they pertain to your quest.
	( ! ) It is safe to use the default values here, EXCEPT for this constant:
		FFC_ENEMY_EXPLODE
		You must assign the slot number of the FFC to this. O
		( ! ) For the present, leave it set to '1', then after you compile, and
		      assign the ffc script 'Explosion' to a slot, note the slot, go back
		      and change this value to match, and RECOMPILE.
	
	FFC_ENEMY_EXPLODE = 1; //Set to FFC script slot for death explosion FFC animation.
	FFC_NUM_OF_EXPLOSIONS = 4; //Base number of explosions when killing an enemy.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_SPRITE = 0; //Sprite for the explosion.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_EXTEND = 3; //Size of explosion eweapon.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_TILEWIDTH = 1; //Width of explosion, in tiles.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_TILEHEIGHT = 1; //Height of explosion, in tiles.

	FFC_EXPLOSIONS_MINIBOSS_EXTRA = 4; //Add this many explosions if the enemy is a miniboss.
	FFC_EXPLOSIONS_BOSS_EXTRA = 12; //Add this many explosions if the enemy is a full boss.
	FFC_EXPLOSIONS_FINALBOSS_EXTRA = 16; //Add this many explosions if the enemy is the FINAL boss.

	FFC_EXPLOSION_SPRITE_NORMAL_ENEM = 87; //Sprite to use for ordinary enemy explosions.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_SPRITE_ENEM_MINIBOSS = 9; //Sprite for explosions if the enemy is a mini-boss.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_SPRITE_ENEM_BOSS = 17; //Sprite for explosions if the enemy is a Boss.
	FFC_EXPLOSION_SPRITE_ENEM_FINAL_BOSS = 81; //Sprite for explosions if the enemy if the FINAL BOSS 
						   //in the game.

	FFC_EXPLOSION_DELAY = 4; //The delay in frames between explosions.

	FFC_EXPLOSION_PIECE_OF_POWER_EXTRA_BLASTS = 2; //Number of extra explosions if player has Piece of Power
							//power-up (attack) boost.
							 
	EXPLODE_INVIS_COMBO = 735; //A general use invisible combo, that we never actually use. This is here 
				   //as a reference only.
	( ! ) You do not need to modify the value of EXPLODE_INVIS_COMBO It is here as a catch-all 
	      during development.
	EXPLOSION_TWO_DIST = 2; //The distance modifier (in PIXELS) for the second explolsion 
				//effect (layered explosions).
	EXPLOSION_THREE_DIST = 3; //The distance modifier (in PIXELS) for the third explolsion 
				  //effect (layered explosions).
	EXPLOSION_FOUR_DIST = 4; //The distance modifier  (in PIXELS)for the fourth explolsion 
				 //effect (layered explosions).

	EXPLOSION_DIST_NORMAL = 8; 	//The -N and +N values to Randomise for distance of explosion 
					//FFC for normal enemies.
	EXPLOSION_DIST_MINIBOSS = 12; 	//The -N and +N values to Randomise for distance of explosion 
				        //FFC for Mini-Boss enemies.
	EXPLOSION_DIST_BOSS = 16; 	//The -N and +N values to Randomise for distance of explosion
					//FFC for Boss enemies.
	EXPLOSION_DIST_FINAL_BOSS = 24; //The -N and +N values to Randomise for distance of explosion 
					//FFC for your FINAL BOSS enemy.
	EXPLOSION_DIST_OTHER = 10;  	//The -N and +N values to Randomise for distance of explosion FFC 
					//as a CATCH_ALL for enemies not included elsewhere.

12. Take the notes that you made during STEP 6, and examine the following arrays:
	BossList[]
	MiniBossList[]
	
	( A ) Add any new mini-boss enemies by their number to the array MiniBossList[] as follows:
		EXAMPLE, add Enemy ID 200 to this list:
			Find a spot in the table to add the value, and enter it:
			
			ORIGINAL TABLE:
			int MiniBossList[]={	59, 	66,	67,	68,	
						69, 	70,	71,	74,	
						75};
						
			AFTER ADDING AN ENEMY (ID 200):
				int MiniBossList[]={	59, 	66,	67,	68,	
							69, 	70,	71,	74,	
							75,	200};
		( ! ) Array values are separated by commas, EXCEPT for the last value. 
			
	( B ) Add any new BOSS enemies to the array BossList[], ad follows:
		EXAMPLE: Add enemy ID 201 to this list:
			Find a spot in the table to add the value, and enter it:
		
		ORIGINAL TABLE: 
		int BossList[]={	58,	61,	62,	63, 
					64, 	65, 	71, 	72, 
					73, 	76, 	77, 	93, 	
					94, 	103, 	104, 	105, 	
					109, 	110, 	111, 	112, 	
					114, 	121, 	122};
		
		TABLE AFTER ADDING AN ENEMY (ID 201):
		int BossList[]={	58,	61,	62,	63, 
					64, 	65, 	71, 	72, 
					73, 	76, 	77, 	93, 	
					94, 	103, 	104, 	105, 	
					109, 	110, 	111, 	112, 	
					114, 	121, 	122, 	201};
		( ! ) Array values are separated by commas, EXCEPT for the last value. 
	
	( C ) 	Assign the value of your FINAL BOSS to this constant:
		
		FINAL_BOSS_ID = 78; //Enemy ID of the FINAL boss. Ganon, by default.
			      //Note: The standard Ganon battle has its own, SPECIAL DEATH ANIMATION 
			      //that is incompatible with custom explosion animations. 
			      //Change this value to your actual, custom, final boss.
			      //If you are using the stock Ganon, you will need to disable FINAL_BOSS_EXPLOSIONS.
		
13. Set up MIDI constants, if desired:
	
	POWERUP_MIDI = 10; //Set the the number of a MIDI to play while a Power-Up is in effect.
	PLAYING_POWER_UP_MIDI = 256;
	NORMAL_DMAP_MIDI = 0; //Used for two things: Array index of normal DMap MIDIs (base), 
				//and as parameter in function PlayPowerUpMIDI()



14. If you DO NOT have global scripts for 'Active', 'OnContinue', 'OnExit', you may use the included 
   skeleton template scripts. Otherwise, for your GLOBAL ACTIVE SCRIPT, place the following function
   calls BEFORE Waitdraw(); in the EXACT ORDER that they appear, below: 
   
	StoreLinkHurt();
	ResetConsecutiveKills();
	KillRoutines();
	EnemyPieceOfPower();
	EnemyGuardianAcorn();
	ReduceBuffTimers();
	LinksAwakeningItems();
	GivePowerUps();
	
   If you do not have a Waitdraw() instruction in your global active script, you add it in the infinite
   ( while (true) ) loop, before Waitframe();. Use the included example as a guide.
   
   If you have either (or both) OnContinue, OnExit, add the following instructions to each of them, at
   the very top of each:
   
	Z4_ItemsAndTimers[DEF_TIMER] = 0;
	Z4_ItemsAndTimers[POWER_TIMER] = 0;
	
   Again, use the included examples as a guide for statement/instruction placement. 
   ( ! ) If you do not have any of the scripts mentioned in this step, you may safely use the EXAMPLE scripts
         distributed with this package.
   

15. COMPILE, and assign scripts to slots.
	( ! ) If you have not previously done this:
	
	1. Go to the ZQ menu, and select: Quest->Scripts->COmpile ZScript
	   Either add an import directive to your existing buffer, or use the import button to
	   copy the code of LinksAwakening.z to your buffer. If you do this, be sure to enable
	   ' import "std.zh" ' at the very top, by removing the slashes. 
	2. Click 'Compile'.
	3. You will see the compiler working. When it is finished, it will return 'Success'.
	4. Press 'OK'.
	5. You will be prompted to assign scripts to slots.
	6. Assign the global scripts Active, OnContinue, and OnExit to the slots with matching names.
	7. Assign the item scripts to free slots.
	8. Click 'OK'.
	9. You may export assembly code, if you desire.
	10. Click the final 'OK' prompt to complete this process.


16. Go back to the script, and set the constants for FFC_ENEMY_EXPLODE as detailed in Step 11, then RECOMPILE. 
	
17. You are done, and ready to use the new items. Their use is automated by the global scripts, and
    requires no further tinkering. 

18. SAVE ( ! ) your quest file with a NEW FILENAME !
    
PLEASE REFER TO THE EXAMPLE QUEST IF YOU RUN INTO ANY STUMBLING POINTS.
