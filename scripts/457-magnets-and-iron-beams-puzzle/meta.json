You can lift and place magnets (Ex1). if you place a magnet in such a way, that his poles point at iron beam via straight, unobstructed line, the beam will start moving torwards magnet, until either hit a solid combo, or touch a magnet itself, which causes both beam and magnet to be completely stuck and immobile.Update3.5.2022 - Added static magnets - Attracts iron beams, when activated either by standing on and pressing EX1, or just stepped on.",
