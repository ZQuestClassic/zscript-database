  "description": "This NPC will display one message the first time you talk to it and can have a different response every time after that. It can warp you to another screen and heal you. It can detect the value of counters used in the game, like rupees and bombs or ones you create; then activate secrets to either open a path or reward you. Primarily created to ease setup of NPCs used in trading quests, rewards for collecting special items and cutscenes between dungeons that don't have Triforce pieces.",

Assign to an ffc and set the attributes.// d0: String number to be displayed// D1: Set to anything other than zero. Tells the ffc that this NPC has more than one message. Use string control codes to determine what message to display.
