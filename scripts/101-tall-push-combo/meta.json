  "setup": "Place ffc on the screen above the pushable combo so it's aligned on the combo grid. It can be up to 4 tiles high and should have overlay flag set. Set it's TileHeight so the ffc's bottom is touching; but not overlapping the base combo. Then attach the script and apply a push flag to the base combo and your ready to go. NOTE: The base combo is the Push Block placed on the screen NOT the ffc.Requires std.zh which is included with zc.",
