D7 - Y size, negative to just render target image, not accept solution4. ffc script RenderPriorityInputer  Place multiple FFCs to form individual tiles that are swapped and rotated prior to combing.    D0 - number of combos in sequence.   D1 - order of tile placement, must be unique per FFC from range 0-5.   D2 - 0 -> disable rotating.   D3 - translucent, if >0.A note on designing puzzles, make sure that target image can only be builat with unique, order of tile overlappings, no ambiguity is allowed.",
