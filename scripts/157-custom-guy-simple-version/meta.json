I consider an essential part of making a new quest in today's age in Zelda Classic. It takes any tile and a CSet, specified by you. It's really nice use for classic-based quests where you're limited by the editor.Credits:CJC, BigJoe, Mero, SUCCESSOR: We've been discussing some scripting round-table, especially those that don't use globals or autoghost.",
