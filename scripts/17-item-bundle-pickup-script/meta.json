  "info": "This is an item pickup script that lets you bundle up to 8 inventory item pickups into a single pickup. It also has an optional item message functionality (at the cost of the first inventory slot if you choose to use it) so that you don't have to give up having an item pickup message to use the script.\n\nIt was mostly made to bundle the bow and arrows into a single item, but I'm sure it could have other uses.",

  "setup": "This is an item pickup script. Attach it to an item (preferably not an actual inventory item).D0-D7: Items to give (the item ID is shown in the item editor)D0: If D0 is negative, it will display an item pickup message containing the positive version of the number entered. -1 would display string 1, -42 would display string 42.For the item message, you should probably have the quest rule for strings freezing action turned on.If you bundle this with an item that increases counters, you could create grouped items such as a fully functional bow that gives you the bow item, the arrows item, and arrows for your quiver.",
