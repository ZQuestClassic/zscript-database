  "setup": "Put EITHER the FFC script or the Global script into your script file, along with the constants at the top and the three functions at the bottom. The first constant is used to determine the speed of the currents, and the second is the first of 4 flags to use (defaults to 98 for up, 99 for down, 100 for left, and 101 for right). If using the FFC version, the FFC's D0 argument will override the frequency constant, allowing you to set a different current speed for each screen.",
