  "description": "This is a header of mine that I made for bosses that use laser weapons. While the functions themselves are pretty self explanatory, it comes with no documentation as I made it for personal use. Since it's seen some use in scripts already, I'm putting it on the database for compatibility purposes. Documentation may be added in the future.",
