  "description": "Simply, allows a simple day/night tint. Day is untinted, while night is tinted. Optionally can only run outdoors (\"Overworld\" or \"BS Overworld\" screens)",
  "setup": "Headers: Requires Tint.zh, std.zhSet the constants near the top of the DayNight namespace.DAY_LENGTH: Time, in minutes, for day and night to last (they each last the same time)ONLY_OUTDOORS: If true (which is default), will not do tinting while indoors (i.e. not on an overworld screen). The timer will still run.NIGHT_R, NIGHT_G, NIGHT_B: RGB values for the tint. These are set to a default tint for darkness, though different tilesets may work better with different tints, so I made these constants that you can modify.Scripts:An Init Script is included, as defined by Tint.zh setup. This also includes an additional init line, to initialize the night tint.A onContinue script is included, as defined by Tint.zh setup.An active script is included. This handles the actual timer, and the calls to toggle day/night based on the timer. It also includes a call to `DayNight::handletint()`, which handles the indoors/outdoors option, and `TintZH::runTints()`, as required by Tint.zh.",
