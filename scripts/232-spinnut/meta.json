  "setup": "Requires std.zh, string.zh, and ghost.zh. Use GhostZHActiveScript in your global active script slot, or combine ghost.zh global functions with your existing global active script. Adjust the 5 constants at the top of the script file to your liking. The null sprite should be any blank tile, NOT tile 0! The Spinnut's sword doesn't need a sprite, it only needs a single sword tile whose blade is pointing right.Set up the enemy as follows:Type: OtherMisc. Attribute 1: How long Spinnut stops before it begins charging its sword.Misc. Attribute 2: How long Spinnut charges its sword before spinning.Misc. Attribute 3: How long Spinnut spins.Misc. Attr. 11: -1 to use default enemy tile, combo number for comboMisc. Attr. 12: The slot number of this script, or -1 to try finding the script from the enemy name.Damage, W. Damage, Hunger, Random Rate, Halt Rate, Homing Factor, and Step Speed all work as normal (see example quest for suggestions).",
