  "description": "Tetris-like pushable blocks, alternate variant + remote controller that can push and rotate pushblocks at distance.\nRemote control has the following actions, when stood on:\nEx1 - push Tetris Block it controls one space in Link`s direction. Works only, if space is free from solid combos\nand NoPushblock flags.\nEx2 - rotates Tetris Block clockwise, if unobstructed.\nNon-solid klotski-like tetromino. Stand on it, face desired direction and press EX1 to move it.\nLift and place polyominoes. Ex1 to lift and place, EX2 to rotate,if held.\nCredit goes to Moosh for technical assistance.\nUpdate 24.04.2022 - Inherent trigger flags supported.\nUpdate 3.5.2022 - Added 5 new flags - gets stuck after 1 push, gets stuck when landing on trigger, icy block, continue moving in direction until hitting obstacle, ignore triggers, require triggers with same CSet as FFC`s Cset.\nMassive Update 9.6.2022:Added alternate setup process for polyomino shapesAdded non-solid tetris/klotski like blocksAdded lift &  place tetris block puzzles",
