  "description": "Combination lock consisting multiple linked rotateable wheels. Link can press button (stand on it and press EX1) to rotate wheel. Rotating a wheel cause wheels linked to it also rotate, sometimes in bizarre patterns. Some wheels can have move limit which, when expired, causes them to lock in lace and block rotation, both direct and linked, which also prevents other wheels to be rotated directly. Input correct direction on each wheel to solve puzzle.Update 3.5.2022 - Fixed premature secret triggering, involving linked circles in motion.",
  "setup": "1. Setup combos for each button and wheel. Wheel`s combo must be directly below it`s button and has assigned to top left corner of 4x4 tile sheet.2. Import and compile the script.
