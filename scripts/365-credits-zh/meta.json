  "description": "Allows you to create credits, line-by-line, by calling functions to add text. It will draw these out to a bitmap with proper spacing, even resizing the bitmap as needed (which WILL change the bitmap pointer, presently!).You can get the bitmap pointer it uses with a function, should you wish to perform custom draws on it to fancify your credits; but no help is provided in this. All that is provided is simple adding of lines of text (of whatever font, either left/center/right aligned, whatever font color, etc).Includes a function 'rollCredits(int scrollSpeed)', which will scroll the credits across the screen, starting at the bottom.A fairly basic header, but useful for those without experience in custom draws in creating credits.Changelog:05 Dec, 2019 - V1.0 Release31 May, 2021 - V1.01 - no longer uses 'bitmap.zh' header",
  "setup": "Call 'Credits::init()' to set up the credits, then call the various add functions to add lines of text to the credits. When done, call 'Credits::rollCredits(int scrollSpeed)' to scroll them across the screen.",
