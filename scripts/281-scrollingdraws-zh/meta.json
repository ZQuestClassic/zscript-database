You'll probably want ScrollingDraws_Update() to be near the top of the while loop so the positions of your global draws are accurate.\n\nFor scripters, use these functions to get the various positions:ScrollingOldX() - X position of the top left corner of the old screenScrollingOldY() - Y position of the top left corner of the old screenScrollingNewX() - X position of the top left corner of the new screenScrollingNewY() - Y position of the top left corner of the new screenScrollingLinkX() - Link's X position during scrollingScrollingLinkY() - Link's Y position during scrolling\n\nRequires std.zh.",
