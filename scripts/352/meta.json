Defaults to CT_SCRIPT1, and CF_SCRIPT1 through CF_SCRIPT8.A combo which has the set type, AND one of the 8 flags, will act as a conveyor. Each flag corresponds to a direction.Either run a global script (example included), which will handle the conveyors quest-wide, or use an FFC on each screen of the provided FFC script.Benefits of FFC script: Different screens can have different conveyor settingsConveyor combos will function on layer 0, 1, or 2, and accepts both inherent and placed flags (including a combination of them)",

They need to be of the specified type (default \"Script 01\"), and have either an inherent or placed flag from the list. Each flag indicates a different direction.EITHER/OR:GLOBAL SETUP:Either use the example global, or merge it with your current global. You can modify the settings by changing the parameters to the 'runConveyors' function.FFC SETUP:You will need the LinkMovement.zh global setup still.Place an FFC with the script attached on each screen you want to have conveyors. Set the arguments as follows:D0: Speed (in pixels per frame)D1: Set to 1 if you want the conveyors to affect the playerD2: Set to 1 if you want the conveyors to affect enemiesD3: Set to 1 if you want the conveyors to affect itemsThat's... about it.",
