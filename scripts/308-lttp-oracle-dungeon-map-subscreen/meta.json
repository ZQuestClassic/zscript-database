  "description": "This script adds a custom subscreen over the normal spacebar map that behaves like the dungeon maps seen in ALttP and the Oracle games. The set up is a little complicated, but once you do it once you can set up your maps right in the ZQuest editor with no need to meddle with arrays. This script supports:Up to 128 dungeons (using level number 0-127)Up to 13 floors per dungeonCustomizable map and marker tilesRooms larger than one screenMultiple DMap floors with automatic state carryovers2 layers of compass markers for items, bosses, lock blocks, and secretsDay 1 Update of Immediate Regret: Added a few more features requested by ywkls. Also fixed a bug with how the floors were being centered.",
  "setup": "Because the setup for this script is a bit more visual than usual, I've included a PDF file in the download package with setup instructions. Leave a comment if you run into any trouble setting it up.This script is optimized for Interior DMaps. NES dungeons should still work, but Overworld DMaps will not. In order to use this script, you'll need the NES fix \"Subscreen Appears Above Sprites\" enabled. This script requires std.zh.",
