  "setup": "Setup the constants indicated within the script. Once you compile and add it to your buffer, create a new Sword Item with a Sword Itemclass (I used the Magic Sword in the default tileset), and in the scripts tab, attach the \"Pickup Script\" in the pickup slot and the \"Action Script\" in the action slot. That's all you need to do!",
