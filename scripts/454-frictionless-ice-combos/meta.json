  "description": "Frictionless IceA common hazard in verious RPG and puzzle games. As soon as one steps on this cruel combo, he will slide indefinetly, across atright line, out of control, until either hitting solid combo, non-slippery stuff, or stright into hazard.Update 8.04.2022 - removed debug stuff.Update 9.04.2022 - fix stupid compile error, fixed misplaced docs inside script fileUpdate 13.01.2023 - Added new item - Ice Skates. Allows Link to sharp turn while sliding on ice like Pac-Man in his old school games. Works only on ice combos flagged with CF_ALLOW_ICE_SKATES combo flag. Also Link will now continue slind in the same direction, if he was direct-warped from one ice combo to another in different screen.",
