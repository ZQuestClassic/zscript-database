  "info": "Creates a Bombchu that can be controlled by Link.",
  "description": "When link uses this item it checks the item's counter reference to make sure he has atleast one ammo. If he does he'll place a bombchu on the ground infront of him and it'll start moving. It moves constantly but the direction can be changed with the arrow keys. Link cannot move while using it, and it'll explode if Link get's hurt or it collides with an enemy or solid object. As far as solidity is concerned you can have the bombchu treat solid combos as walk-able and vice versa by placing a bombchu flag over the combo location on layer 0.",
