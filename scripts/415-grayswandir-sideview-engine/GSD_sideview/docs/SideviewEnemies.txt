|         Sideview Enemies Setup          |
+-----------------------------------------+
This sideview enemy pack uses Saffith's ghost.zh header, specifically the AutoGhost global script. You can find ghost.zh and a tutorial by Saffith for setting up autoghosted enemies in this post:

All enemies in this pack should use the Other enemy type and have their Misc Attr. 11 and 12 in the Data 2 tab set to the combo and FFC script number they use. Since the enemies use combos for graphics, their tiles don't matter and can be set to whatever you want. It's better to at least set them to something so they don't show up invisible in ZQuest. Note that most of the enemy attributes listed here have defaults if you leave them as 0. I only point them out if I feel it's something special or would avoid confusion

+-----------------------------------------+
|             Wall Crawler                |

WeaponDamage: How much damage the weapons that appear when it dies deal
Step: How fast the enemy moves when rising after attack (pixel per frame x 100) (defaults to 85)
Homing Factor: How close to the enemy Link needs to be for it to drop
Attribute 11: Script slot. Needed so enemy, when set to be solid, won`t get crushed by FFC it ghosts.

Place FFC where you want the thwomp to be. Assign script slot and TileWidth and TileHeight for size.
D0 - ID of enemy in Enemy editor.
D1 - Thwomp direction. 0-Up, 1-Down, 2-Left, 3-Right.
D2 - Thwomp solidity. 0-none, 1-solid-on-top, 2-fully solid
D3 - The number of weapons the enemy explodes into. (0 for thwomp behavior)
D4 - Add 2 numbers together
    1. Set this flag and Thwomp will deal variable damage depending on the speed in the moment of hitting Link,
 		ranging from half a heart to the original damage at terminal velocity.
    2. Set this flag and thwomp will transform into pushable solid block when killed.
D5 - How fast the weapons it explodes into move (pixel per frame x 100) (0, if used explosion)
D6 - What type of weapon it explodes into (override). (stay away from boomerang)

+-----------------------------------------+
|            Burrowing Enemy              |
+-----------------------------------------+
This enemy type appears out of the ground, moves about, then digs down again. It can stay in the same place or teleport around.

Enemy editor settings:
Step: How fast the enemy moves (pixel per frame x 100)
Attribute 1: Whether the enemy stays in place or moves around after burrowing. 0=Stays in place, 1=Moves around
Attribute 2: How long the enemy stays underground.
Attribute 3: How long the enemy stays above ground.
Attribute 4: The speed of the emerging animation, slower=faster animation. (default 8)
Attribute 5: Randomness factor. This applies to the boss coming out of and going back into the ground. Higher numbers mean it's less likely to emerge or submerge after the limits for both are reached. 0 results in no randomness.
Attribute 6: Whether the enemy respawns when killed. 0=No, 1=Yes

Combo Setup:
Up, Down, Left, Right (Burrowing 1)
Up, Down, Left, Right (Burrowing 2)
Up, Down, Left, Right (Above ground)

Note: Try to keep Step fairly normal when using randomness. Randomness relates in part to step and so it's possible to make a leever that never submerges by mistake.


+-----------------------------------------+
|             Shooting Enemy              |
+-----------------------------------------+
This enemy type uses a halting walker pattern with a variety of weapon firing choices. Even with no weapon, this enemy can be handy as it doesn't seem to suffer from some of the solidity detection bugs normal enemies do.

Enemy editor settings:
Weapon: What type of eweapon it uses (boomerang not recommended for most firing types)
Weapon Damage: Same as usual
Random Rate: Same as usual
Halt Rate: Same as usual
Homing Factor: Same as usual
Step: How fast the enemy moves (pixel per frame x 100) (aka same as usual)
Attribute 1: Shot Type
Attribute 2: Shot Speed (pixel per frame x 100)
Attribute 3: Shot Misc1
Attribute 4: Shot Misc2
Attribute 5: Shot Sprite (use a special sprite for the weapon, otherwise use the default)
Attribute 6: Shot Sound (use a special sound for the weapon, otherwise use the default)

Shot Type 0 (Directional Shot)
Shoots a weapon in the direction the enemy is facing. This is the only shot type I think the boomerang weapon might work with.
Misc 1: Height of sine wave (0 for no sine wave)
Misc 2: Width of sine wave

Shot Type 1 (Aimed Shot)
Shoots an angular weapon aimed at Link. Should turn the enemy accordingly.
Misc 1: Height of sine wave (0 for no sine wave)
Misc 2: Width of sine wave

Shot Type 2 (Rapid Fire Aimed Shot)
Shoots several angular weapons aimed at Link in a row.
Misc 1: Whether or not to reaim for each weapon. 0=No, 1=Yes
Misc 2: How many shots to fire

Misc 1: ID of the enemy to summon
Misc 2: Number of enemies to summon

Combo Setup:
Up, Down, Left, Right (Walking)
Up, Down, Left, Right (Firing)

Note: Even though this is the most customizable script, I feel like it doesn't have enough firing patterns at the moment, but it is what it is. Use regular enemy editor enemies alongside it if that suits your fancy, just be careful with your 1 tile wide gaps in room design so they don't walk into the walls.


+-----------------------------------------+
|                  Boo                    |
+-----------------------------------------+
This enemy type moves towards the player and becomes vulnerable while their back is turned. It stops moving and becomes invincible when they face it. A clever trick shot can technically hit it, so sword immunity is recommended.

Enemy editor settings:
Step: How fast the enemy moves (pixel per frame x 100)
Attribute 1: How fast the enemy homes in on Link. (Confusing arbitrary value, 1 is very imprecise and anything above that adds more precision. You'll probably have to play around with it.)

Combo Setup:
Moving Left, Moving Right, Hiding Left, Hiding Right


+-----------------------------------------+
|              Wall Hopper                |
+-----------------------------------------+
This enemy type hops from one wall to the next. The starting direction depends on positioning and if not next to a wall it will randomize. When Link steps near enough to the enemy's axis, it will hop to the other side.

Enemy editor settings:
Step: How fast the enemy moves (pixel per frame x 100)
Attribute 1: Whether it moves horizontally or vertically. 0=Horizontal, 1=Vertical
Attribute 2: The delay before the enemy Jumps. With a value of -1 the enemy waits for Link to be in position and then waits for him to leave position before moving again. With a value of -2 the enemy jumps back and forth as long as Link is in position. Anything higher and it waits that many frames before jumping again.
Attribute 3: How close to the enemy's axis Link needs to be to trigger it

Combo Setup:
Up, Down, Left, Right (Stationary)
Up, Down, Left, Right (Jumping)



+-----------------------------------------+
|              Lazy Chase                 |
+-----------------------------------------+
This enemy type tries to adjust its velocity to be moving towards Link but as long as Link moves, oftentimes misses. You know what they say, the Lazy Chase gets killed off by the Dracus. Ahem, anyways, it can also be used for Metroids.

Enemy editor settings:
Weapon Damage: The drain damage metroid types use.
Attribute 1: The enemy's acceleration (pixels per frame per frame * 1000)
Attribute 2: The enemy's max velocity (pixels per frame * 100)
Attribute 3: Whether the enemy can fly through walls. 0=No, 1=Yes
Attribute 4: Type of enemy. 0=Normal, 1=Metroid (HP drain), 2=Metroid (MP drain), 3=Metroid (rupee drain)
Attribute 5: Frames between each tick of damage from the drain effect.
Attribute 6: The sound (should be short) that plays every time the drain happens

Combo Setup:
Uses only one combo


+-----------------------------------------+
|             Wizzrobe Fix                |
+-----------------------------------------+
This script just makes it so an enemy can't fall. 
It makes floating wizzrobes actually an acceptable enemy in sideview although I don't believe it works for much else.

Enemy editor settings: 
None

Combo Setup:
Use -1/GH_INVISIBLE_COMBO

+-----------------------------------------+
